chatgpt identified trends and possible outliers for the data set:

The age distribution shows a typical range between 51 and 66 years, with a mean of about 58 years. However, there is a minimum age of 1, which might be an outlier or a data entry error. The maximum age is 91, which seems reasonable.

Disease Prevalence:
Diabetes (D) and Hypertension (H) are among the most common conditions.
Cataracts (C) and Glaucoma (G) also have a significant presence.
Pathological Myopia (M) and Age-related Macular Degeneration (A) are less common.
Age-Related Trends:

Diabetes and Hypertension increase in frequency with age.
Cataracts and Glaucoma are more prevalent in older age groups.
Other diseases (O) are spread across all age groups but peak in middle age.
Younger age groups (0-20, 21-40) have very few cases, likely reflecting a bias in the dataset toward older individuals.
