Predicting Ocular Disease

Problem Statement: The early detection of ocular diseases including glaucoma, cataracts, and age-related macular degeneration is vital to ensure healthy eyes in patients across the world. Many people do not have access to the medical support necessary to detect these issues, which can lead to severe health complications. There is a need for viable and readily available methods for identifying ocular diseases.

Project Idea: This project aims to address these challenges by using machine learning models to classify ocular diseases.  Our model will be trained by thousands of retinal images in order to accurately diagnose a wide range of eye conditions.

Proposed Timeline:

- Week 1: EDA Part 1
Clean the dataset (handle missing values and outliers).
Visualize data distribution and detect class imbalances.

- Week 2: EDA Part 2
Explore evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score).
Apply augmentations (e.g., flipping, rotation) to increase dataset diversity if necessary.

- Week 3: Baseline Model Development
Build a simple baseline CNN or use a pre-trained model (like ResNet).
Set up the training pipeline and evaluate initial performance.

- Week 4: Advanced Model Development
Fine-tune pre-trained models for ocular disease prediction.
Experiment with architectures and hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, batch size).

- Week 5: Model Optimization
Perform advanced hyperparameter tuning.
Generate classification reports and confusion matrices.

- Week 6: Deployment Preparation
Export the trained model for deployment.
Develop a simple web or mobile interface (TensorFlow Lite).

- Week 7: Deployment and Testing
Deploy the app and test with unseen images. Debug as needed.

- Week 8: Documentation and Presentation
Document project findings (EDA, models, and results).
Prepare your Mid-Year Showcase presentation.
